description: You're a master of akimbo pistols, wielding a high caliber firearm in each hand.  Your attacks primarily deal lethal damage and you have a wide variety of attacks, however your strength lies within your ability to use your ""Swap Ammo"" power to change out your ammo mid-battle.  Doing so can change your secondary damage type and effects making you an incredibly versatile ranged combatant.
