description: You are able to harness the power of Radiation to crush your foes at range and in close quarters. Radioactive Assault attacks have a chance to inflict the Contaminated state on a target for a moderate amount of time. Powers that deal greater damage, have a longer recharge time and animation time have a greater chance to inflict Contaminated. Hitting Contaminated targets with Neutrino Bolt, Contaminated Strike, Radiation Siphon, X-Ray Beam, Proton Volley and Devastating Blow cause a portion of that power's damage to also hit nearby foes. Radiation Assault attacks primarily deal smashing and energy damage, but this set is also capable of dealing some toxic damage.
