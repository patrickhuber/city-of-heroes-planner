description: Claws are bones or blades that extend from your hands and cause Lethal damage. The lightweight, natural feel of claws gives this power set a reduced Endurance cost and faster attack rate than other Scrapper melee sets. Like all scrapper powers, all Claw attacks can sometimes land a critical hit for double damage.
