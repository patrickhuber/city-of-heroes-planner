description_short: PBAoE, Foe Confuse
description_long: 'Aura of Confusion can cause chaos within a group of foes. All affected foes within the area will turn and attack each other, ignoring the user and their allies. If you confuse a foe before they noticed you, your presence will continue to go unnoticed. You will not receive any Experience Points for foes defeated entirely by confused enemies.
