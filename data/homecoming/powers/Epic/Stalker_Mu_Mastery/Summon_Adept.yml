description_short: 'Summon Mu Adept: Ranged Moderate DMG(Energy)'
description_long: 'Scirocco has shown you how to call upon a mystical Mu Adept to assist you. The Mu pulse with the blood of their slaughtered ancestors in their veins, and are well practiced in the dark arts. Your access to this Adept is very limited. You can only summon him once every 15 minutes and he will leave after 4 minutes, or if you exit a zone or mission. You must be level 44 and have two other Mu Mastery Powers before selecting this power. Recharge: Extremely Long'
