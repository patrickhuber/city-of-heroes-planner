description_short: Summon Lich
description_long: 'Summons a dark and powerful Lich.  The lich is an undead entity that, when alive, possessed many dark powers of his own.  Perhaps it was a dark wizard, or powerful arch villain.  Perhaps it was even a Necromancer.  Now it only hungers for the souls of the living, and is quite good at feeding itself. The Lich specializes in dark control and draining powers. You may only have 1 Lich under your control at any given time.  If you attempt to summon another Lich, the power will fail. Recharge: Very Long'
