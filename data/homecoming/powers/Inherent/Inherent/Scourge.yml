description_short: 'Auto: Critical Damage'
description_long: The Corruptor is a dastardly villain indeed.  As a Corruptor's foe health wanes, the Corruptor can start to land Scourge Hits with his attack powers for up to Double Damage.  The weaker the target is, the greater chance the Corruptor has on landing Scourge.  Once a foe is weak enough, there is no escaping the Corruptors wrath. The Corruptor shows no mercy.
