description_long: Sentinels are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in their foes' defenses. By sharing this strategic information with their teammates, any enemy that a Sentinel focuses attacks on will be easier to hit and will suffer an additional 5% damage from incoming attacks. Multiple Sentinels can work together to make this effect stronger. Occasionally, the Sentinel may find an extreme vulnerability in a target that can be exploited to deliver up to 25% additional damage against it for a limited time. Only one such extreme vulnerability may be exploited at a time.
