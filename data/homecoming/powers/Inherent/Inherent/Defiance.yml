description_long: Blasters' earliest abilities come so naturally to them, that they are accessible even in states that normally prevent them from using powers, such as being Held, Slept or Stunned.  Additionally, each time the Blaster attacks with a primary or secondary power, they gain a stacking damage bonus for the next 7.5 seconds.  The amount of the damage bonus is dependent on the exact power used, with single target abilities generally giving the largest bonus.
