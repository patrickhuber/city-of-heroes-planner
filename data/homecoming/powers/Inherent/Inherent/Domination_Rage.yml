description_long: 'Nothing delights a Dominator more than inflicting pain.  Each time a Dominator attacks, their sadistic nature grows. When your Domination bar is over 90%, you can activate this power to unleash their true potential. Your control powers will typically last 50 percent longer and will more easily Dominate stronger opponents. Additionally, you will fully recharge your Endurance and gain resistance to status protection. Recharge: Very Long'
