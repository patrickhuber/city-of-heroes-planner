description_long: Each stack of Blood Frenzy grants you a small damage and endurance discount buff. It is also consumed by certain powers to empower them. Blood Frenzy stacks up to 5 times. Shred deals additional damage and has a chance to immediately recharge itself per stack of Blood Frenzy. Rending Flurry's damage is increased by each stack of Blood Frenzy, additionally if you have 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy this power's radius is increased. Blood Thirst's heal over time effect is increased with each stack of Blood Frenzy. Additionally, using Blood Thirst with 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy will cause the heal over time effect to heal for a longer duration. Hemorrhage's bleed effect is greatly increased by each stack of Blood Frenzy and executing this power with 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy will increase the duration of the damage over time effect. Using Shred, Rending Flurry, Blood Thirst or Hemorrhage with 5 stacks of Blood Frenzy will cause you to be Exhausted for 8 seconds. While Exhausted you cannot build stacks of Blood Frenzy.
