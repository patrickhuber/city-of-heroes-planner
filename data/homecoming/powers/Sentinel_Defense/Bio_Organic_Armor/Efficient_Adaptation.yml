description_short: 'Toggle: Bio Armor Efficient Mode'
description_long: By activating this power you cause your Bio Armor to spontaneously mutate, causing it to become evenly distributed along your body. While active Hardened Carapace grants a minor Endurance Discount, Boundless Energy grants additional regeneration and recovery, Ablative Carapace grants a bonus to regeneration and both DNA Siphon and Parasitic Aura grant increased regeneration and recovery and Genetic Corruption grants a minor regeneration buff.  Efficient Adaptation costs no endurance.
