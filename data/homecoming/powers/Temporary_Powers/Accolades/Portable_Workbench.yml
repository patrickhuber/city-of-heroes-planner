description_short: Summon Portable Workbench
description_long: You can use this power to summon a portable worktable.  It will follow you and your team mates to craft recipes while 'in the field' instead of needing to return to your base or to the university to do so.  It can be used once per hour and lasts for 5 minutes each time it is summoned.  You may not summon the Portable Workbench in PVP enabled areas.
