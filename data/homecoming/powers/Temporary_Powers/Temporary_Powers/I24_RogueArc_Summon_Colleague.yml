description_short: 'Hammers of Justice Summon: Colleague'
description_long: You upheld your agreement with Colleague and paid her as agreed at the conclusion of your work with the Hammers of Justice. She rewarded you with an opportunity to call her on an untraceable, discardable cell-phone, which will summon her to  assist you in battle for 5 minutes. You can only have one cell-phone number for Colleague at a time. You must be level 30 or higher for her to take your call. If you become a villain or a reinforced villain, she will not answer your call until you switch to at least a neutral alignment. If you have already summoned Second Measure or Network, you will not be able to summon Colleague until they depart.
