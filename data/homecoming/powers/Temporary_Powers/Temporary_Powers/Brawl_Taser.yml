description_short: Ranged Minor DMG(Energy), Foe Hold
description_long: "Being of technological origin, you have access to many little devices, one of which is a Taser Dart of your own design. This attack has a very short range and does minor Energy damage to your target. In addition it has a chance to Hold your opponent for a brief moment. This power receives a damage bonus that decreases as you level up.  At around level 15 you stop benefiting from this power's damage bonus altogether.  Damage: Minor, Recharge: Fast"
