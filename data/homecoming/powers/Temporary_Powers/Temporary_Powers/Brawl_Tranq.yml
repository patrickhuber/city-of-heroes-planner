description_short: Ranged Minor DMG(Lethal/Toxic), Foe Sleep
description_long: "As a person of scientific origin you have access to many chemicals and agents. This Tranq Dart is the result of experiments you have conducted, and can be used at short range to deal minor Lethal and Toxic damage to a target. In addition there is a small chance you can put the target to Sleep with this dart, but they will wake up the next time they are damaged or healed. This power receives a damage bonus that decreases as you level up.  At around level 15 you stop benefiting from this power's damage bonus altogether.  Damage: Minor, Recharge: Fast"
