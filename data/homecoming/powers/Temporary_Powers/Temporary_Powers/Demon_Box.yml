description_short: 'Magic Origin: Summon Wailer, Non-Magic Origin: Tar Patch'
description_long: This a small carved box made of wood stained black carved with intricate sigils, while silver hinges and clasp keep the box closed. It trembles slightly in your hand and you hear dark whispers in your mind. The Demon Box can call upon the powers of darkness to snare your foes with living darkness from the netherworld. If you are of Magic Origin, you can unleash the demonic minions within the box instead! You may call upon the power of the Demon Box three times before the wailing demons within it are drained of all their dark energies.
