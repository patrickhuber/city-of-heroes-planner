description_short: Ranged, Special
description_long: The Particle Cannon is a heavy Rikti weapon that can reverse the polarity of an entity brought through a dimensional rift, sending it back to its own universe.  Against other targets, it has no effect. The Particle Cannon can send the Hydra Head back to its dimension. The particle beam is slow, and must be held on the target for a long time. The Particle Cannon has limited charges, so use it wisely.
