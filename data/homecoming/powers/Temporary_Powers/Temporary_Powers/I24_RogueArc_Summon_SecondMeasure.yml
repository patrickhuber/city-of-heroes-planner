description_short: 'Hammers of Justice Summon: Second Measure'
description_long: You upheld your agreement with Second Measure and paid him as agreed at the conclusion of your work with the Hammers of Justice. He rewarded you with an opportunity to call him on an untraceable, discardable cell-phone, which will summon him to assist you in battle for 5 minutes. You can only have one cell-phone number for Second Measure at a time. You must be level 30 or higher for him to take your call.  If you become a villain or a reinforced villain, he will not answer your call until you switch to at least a neutral alignment. If you have already summoned Colleague or Network, you will not be able to summon Second Measure until they depart.
