description_short: Summon Shivan
description_long: Using this weird 'Shiva Shard' while near the ground allows you to summon forth a powerful Shivan Decimator to fight at your side. The Shivan can be buffed and healed, but is an unwilling companion and will not follow you through doors or into new zones. The Shard can summon 5 Shivans before it is drained.
