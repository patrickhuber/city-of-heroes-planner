description_short: Destroy Reinforcement Door
description_long: This powerful molecular acid has a wide variety of military-industrial applications, but its most immediate use is to disable the Reinforcement Doors within Lambda Sector with a single application. Disabling these doors prevents Praetor White's IDF reinforcements from using that access point to join the fray.
