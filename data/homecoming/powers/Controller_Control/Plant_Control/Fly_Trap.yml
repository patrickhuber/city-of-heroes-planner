description_short: 'Summon Fly Trap: Ranged Control Special'
description_long: 'You can summon a giant carnivorous Fly Trap plant beast.  Fly Trap may be an understatement, as this plant beast has a taste for flesh.  The Fly Trap will viciously attack any nearby foes; biting, hurling poisonous Thorns and even casting its own Entangle Roots. The Fly Trap will fight by your side and can be healed and buffed like any teammate. Recharge: Very Long'
