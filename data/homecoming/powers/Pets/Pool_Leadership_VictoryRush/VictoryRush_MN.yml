description_short: Ranged, +Rec (Self,Team), -EndCost(Self,Team)
description_long: The defeat of an opponent gives your team a rush of adrenaline. The excitement of your victory increases the recovery and reduces the endurance cost of your powers. This effect extends to your teammates as well. The total strength of this bonus is dependent upon the rank of the enemy on which this is cast, with Archvillains and Giant Monsters providing the greatest benefit. This power does not stack with multiple castings, though you will always benefit from the most powerful buff which has been applied to you.
