description_short: Enhances Taunt Effectiveness
description_long: Nectanebo used this ankh to call up the spirits of the dead and force them to do his will. One of his favorite tactics was to call upon the ancestors of his foes. This inevitably enraged his enemies, allowing him to taunt them more successfully. Increases taunt duration by {Boost.Attrib.Taunt.Scale}%.
