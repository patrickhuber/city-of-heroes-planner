description_short: Increases Attack Rate
description_long: Patent Pending. This newly discovered theorem can be applied to a single power. It will reduce the recharge time through a new application of quantum physics only recently discovered. Increases recharge rate by {Boost.Attrib.Recharge.Scale}%.
