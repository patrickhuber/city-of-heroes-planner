description_short: Enhances Accuracy
description_long: Pat. Num. 9,243,980,329. This invention can be used to make one attack more accurate by using a bioluminescent filter to detect the natural illumination given off by most creatures and machines. Increases accuracy by {Boost.Attrib.Accuracy.Scale}%.
