description_long: Peacebringers are formed from the fusion of an alien energy being called a Kheldian and a willing host. While Peacebringers take more damage from most attacks, they make up for this weakness with solid hit points, a good variety of energy attack powers and strong defensive powers, inherent flight, and eventually even gain access to two shape-shift forms. Peacebringers become stronger when teamed with non-Kheldian Heroes, gaining bonuses to their own powers based on the archetypes of their team mates.
