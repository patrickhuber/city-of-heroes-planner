description_long: Warshades are former Nictus who have left that dark path behind and reformed, joining with a willing host. While Warshades take more damage from most attacks, they make up for this weakness with solid hit points, a good variety of dark energy attack powers and strong defensive powers, inherent teleport, and eventually even gain access to two shape-shift forms. Warshades become stronger when teamed with non-Kheldian Heroes, gaining bonuses to their own powers based on the archetypes of their team mates.
