description: Water Blast grants you command over the power of water. This can be used to weaken and crush your foes with all the power of a tidal wave. Some Water Blast powers allow the user to build Tidal Power, while others consume Tidal Power. You can have 3 stacks of Tidal Power on yourself at a time. Your Tidal Power can be released to strengthen your Water Burst, Water Jet, Dehydrate and Geyser powers. Using these powers will remove all of your Tidal Power.
