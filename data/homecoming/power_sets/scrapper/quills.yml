description: Spines protrude from your body and can deal damage in melee or at very short ranges. Spines are hollow and hold a neural toxin that deals additional Toxic damage and can Slow or Immobilize your enemies. The toxin is cumulative, and multiple hits will affect a target more strongly.  Very few foes have resistance to Spine poison. Like all scrapper powers, all Spine attacks can sometimes land a critical hit for double damage.
