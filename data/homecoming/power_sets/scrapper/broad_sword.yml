description: Wield a Broad Sword and master a variety of powerful Lethal attacks. Slower than a Katana, the Broad Sword's weight strikes with more force and damage. The Broadsword can reduce an enemy's Defense, allowing other attacks to hit more reliably. The Broad Sword is a powerful melee weapon that has a bonus to Accuracy.  Like all scrapper powers, all Broad Sword attacks can sometimes land a critical hit for double damage.
